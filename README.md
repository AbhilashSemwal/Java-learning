# Java-learning 🧠

This repository tracks my Java learning journey—from fundamentals to OOP—through hands-on code examples and topic-wise folders.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder focuses on a specific topic/lesson:

### 01‑hello‑world  
- Your first Java program: prints “Hello, World!”

### 02‑basic‑program  
- Core concepts: variables, `Scanner` input, printing to console.

### 03-Methods-Practice
- Method creation and invocation
- Return types and parameters
- Input/Output using Scanner

### 04-Variables-DataTypes
- Practice of all 8 primitive types in Java
- Widening (implicit) and narrowing (explicit) type casting
- ASCII value conversion using char and int
- Simple usage of String and boolean types

### 05-Operators
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Relational operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical operators: &&, ||, !
- Assignment operators used in methods
- Unary operators: pre/post increment
- Basic validation added for division and modulus

### 06-Control-Statements
- Decision-making: if, else if, else, nested if
- Multi-branching with switch-case
- Loops: for loop (sum logic), while loop (multiplication table)
- Used break and continue to control loop flow

### 07-OOP-Basics (Classes, Objects, Constructors, Static)

- Implemented basic OOP concepts using:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Constructors and `this` keyword
  - Instance methods and fields
  - Static variables and methods

- **Programs Included:**
  - `Student.java` – Constructor with parameters, method to print details
  - `Car.java` – Class with instance method
  - `Rectangle.java` – Compare area of two rectangles using object data
  - `Counter.java` – Tracks number of objects created using static variable
  - `Employee.java` – Class with static employee counter and detail printer
  - `BankAccount.java` – Deposit, withdraw, balance methods with user input

 ### 08-Encapsulation
- Learned how to hide internal object data using `private` access modifiers
- Implemented controlled access using `getters` and `setters`
- Added validation logic in setters to protect object state
- Used internal status messaging for clean and grouped output
- Followed JavaBeans conventions for method naming

**Programs Included:**
- `EncapsulatedStudent.java`  
  → Demonstrates private fields, validation in setters, controlled access with getters, and structured output with `printDetails()` method
